# BarracksScanner
## Why
At the barracks I manage, they issued us a laptop/barcode scanner to help document personnel traffic in/out of the building
<br />
The software software provided is a Microsoft Access program with really poor UI (it constantly confuses people who operate it, so i always have to show them how to work it, and its generally just very unresponsive)

## How
It has to run on the provided Windows laptop, so I decided on using C++ with the Windows App SDK along with a simple local SQLite database
<br />
The tooling isn't my favorite, but I'm doing my best to navigate it and make something reliable and usable
