# BarracksScanner
## Why
At the barracks I manage, they issued us a laptop/barcode scanner to help document personnel traffic in/out of the building.
<br />
The software that does it is this really shitty Microsoft Access program that the government probably pays some contractor way too much money to install/maintain.

## How
It has to run on this janky Windows laptop they have us, so I'm using C++ with WinUI 3.
<br />
The tooling kinda sucks, but I'm doing my best to navigate the Windows App SDK with all its inconsistencies and bad documentation
